# Guess the Number

This simple Python game is the first Mini-Project of the Ironhack Data Bootcamp.\
It was made with Jupyter Notebook.

# Quick start:

Run the Notebook.\
Your Computer will pick a secret number between 1 and 10.\
You guess what number it is (type your guess and press Enter).\
If your guess is too high or too low, the Computer will give you a hint.\
See how many turns it takes you to win.
